## Zebra \(medicine\)

Zebra is the American medical slang for arriving at an exotic medical diagnosis when a more commonplace explanation is more likely.

> It is shorthand for the aphorism coined in the late 1940s by Dr. Theodore Woodward, professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, who instructed his medical interns: "When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras".\[2\] Since horses are common in Maryland while zebras are relatively rare, logically one could confidently guess that an animal making hoofbeats is probably a horse. By 1960, the aphorism was widely known in medical circles.\[3\]
