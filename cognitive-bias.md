# [Cognitive Bias](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cognitive_bias)

Tendencies to think in certain ways that can lead to systematic deviations from a standard of rationality or good judgements.

Individuals create their own **"subjective social reality"** from their perception of the input. An individual's construction of social reality, not the objective input, may dictate their behaviour in the social world. Thus, cognitive biases may sometimes lead to perceptual distortion, inaccurate judgment, illogical interpretation, or what is broadly called irrationality.

### Bias

Bias arises from various processes that are sometimes difficult to distinguish. These include

* information-processing shortcuts \(heuristics\)
* noisy information processing \(distortions in the process of storage in and retrieval from memory\)
* the brain's limited information processing capacity
* emotional and moral motivations
* social influence

### List of cognitive biases

* Fundamental attribution error
* Confirmation bias
* Self-serving bias
* Belief bias
* Framing
* Hindsight bias

### Note

I consider this mental model comes from **subjective judgement** mostly.
