# [Normal Distribution](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Normal_distribution)

In probability theory, the normal \(or Gaussian\) distribution is a very common continuous probability distribution. Normal distributions are important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known.

### [Central limit theorem](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Central_limit_theorem)

In probability theory, the central limit theorem \(CLT\) establishes that, for the most commonly studied scenarios, when independent random variables are added, their sum tends toward a normal distribution \(commonly known as a bell curve\) even if the original variables themselves are not normally distributed. In more precise terms, given certain conditions, the arithmetic mean of a sufficiently large number of iterates of independent random variables, each with a well-defined \(finite\) expected value and finite variance, will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution.\[1\]\[2\] The theorem is a key concept in probability theory because it implies that probabilistic and statistical methods that work for normal distributions can be applicable to many problems involving other types of distributions.
