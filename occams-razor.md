# [Occam's Razor](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Occam's_razor)

Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.

Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity.

When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras.

### [Conjunction fallacy](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Conjunction_fallacy)

A formal fallacy that occurs when it is assumed that specific conditions are more probable than a single general one. It is also known as **Linda problem**.

> Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.
>
> Which is more probable?
>
> Linda is a bank teller.
>
> Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.

The majority of those asked chose option 2. However, the probability of two events occurring together \(in "conjunction"\) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring alone.
