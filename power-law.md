# [Power law](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Power_law)

In statistics, a power law is a functional relationship between two quantities, where a relative change in one quantity results in a proportional relative change in the other quantity, independent of the initial size of those quantities: one quantity varies as a power of another.

### [Pareto distribution](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pareto_principle)

The Pareto principle \(also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity\)\[1\] states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

### [Diminishing returns](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Diminishing_returns)

In economics, diminishing returns is the decrease in the marginal \(incremental\) output of a production process as the amount of a single factor of production is incrementally increased, while the amounts of all other factors of production stay constant.

The law of diminishing returns states that in all productive processes, adding more of one factor of production, while holding all others constant \("ceteris paribus"\), will at some point yield lower incremental per-unit returns.\[1\] The law of diminishing returns does not imply that adding more of a factor will decrease the total production, a condition known as negative returns, though in fact this is common.

### [Heavy-tailed distribution](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Heavy-tailed_distribution#/Relationship_to_fat-tailed_distributions)

In probability theory, heavy-tailed distributions are probability distributions whose tails are not exponentially bounded:\[1\] that is, they have heavier tails than the exponential distribution. In many applications it is the right tail of the distribution that is of interest, but a distribution may have a heavy left tail, or both tails may be heavy.

There are three important subclasses of heavy-tailed distributions: the **fat-tailed distributions**, the **long-tailed distributions** and the **subexponential distributions**. In practice, all commonly used heavy-tailed distributions belong to the subexponential class.
