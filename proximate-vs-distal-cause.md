# [Proximate vs Distal Cause](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Proximate_and_ultimate_causation)

A proximate cause is an event which is closest to, or immediately responsible for causing, some observed result. This exists in contrast to a higher-level ultimate cause \(or distal cause\) which is usually thought of as the "real" reason something occurred.



### [5 Whys](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/5_Whys)

5 Whys is an iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem. The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question "Why?" Each answer forms the basis of the next question. The "5" in the name derives from an anecdotal observation on the number of iterations needed to resolve the problem.
