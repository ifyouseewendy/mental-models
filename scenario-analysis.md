# [Scenario Analysis](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Scenario_analysis)

A process of analyzing possible future events by considering alternative possible outcomes \(sometimes called "alternative worlds"\). Thus, scenario analysis, which is one of the main forms of projection, does not try to show one exact picture of the future. Instead, it presents several alternative future developments. Consequently, a scope of possible future outcomes is observable.



### [Black swan theory](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Black_swan_theory) 

The black swan theory or theory of black swan events is a metaphor that describes an event that comes as a surprise, has a major effect, and is often inappropriately rationalized after the fact with the benefit of hindsight. The term is based on an ancient saying which presumed black swans did not exist, but the saying was rewritten after black swans were discovered in the wild.

By Nassim Nicholas Taleb

> What we call here a Black Swan \(and capitalize it\) is an event with the following three attributes.
>
> First, it is an **outlier**, as it lies outside the realm of regular expectations, because nothing in the past can convincingly point to its possibility. Second, it carries an **extreme 'impact'**. Third, in spite of its outlier status, human nature makes us **concoct explanations** for its occurrence after the fact, making it explainable and predictable.
>
> I stop and summarize the triplet: rarity, extreme 'impact', and retrospective \(though not prospective\) predictability. A small number of Black Swans explains almost everything in our world, from the success of ideas and religions, to the dynamics of historical events, to elements of our own personal lives.
