# [Systems Thinking](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Systems_thinking)

By taking the overall system as well as its parts into account systems thinking is designed to avoid potentially contributing to further development of unintended consequences.

In systems science, it is argued that the only way to fully understand why a problem or element occurs and persists is to understand the parts in relation to the whole. Standing in contrast to Descartes's scientific reductionism, it proposes to view systems in a holistic manner. Consistent with systems philosophy, systems thinking concerns an understanding of a system by examining the linkages and interactions between the elements that compose the entire system.
